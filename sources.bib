abstract="DESIS(DEfense Software Information System) is being developed to manage and maintain weapon systems software as a whole in defense area. Main goal of the system is to evaluate software quality of weapon systems, analyze whether to violate copy right, and to service technical information. In this paper, we present product quality evaluation function of weapon systems software. First, we developed procedure according to ISO/IEC-9126 to evaluate product quality of weapon systems software. Product quality characteristics have been defined by ISO/IEC-9126, specifically Maintainability for main characteristic, and analyzability, changeability, stability, and testability for minor characteristic. We have obtained common metrics by comparing and analyzing metrics from 3 state analysis softwares in order to establish quality measure metric of sub characteristic. Based on that, we established quality metrics per sub characteristics that let us decide where to attain Maintainability, quality objective, utilizing quality metrics. In addition, we set up desired value broken down by weapon systems classification based upon weapon systems software characteristic. As future work, we will calibrate desired value reflecting development capability and environment of domestic weapon systems software.",
